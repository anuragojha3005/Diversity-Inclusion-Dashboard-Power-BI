This Power BI project presents an interactive dashboard designed to analyze and visualize Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) data within an organization. The goal of this report is to help stakeholders understand representation across various demographics and assess the effectiveness of inclusion efforts over time.

The dashboard highlights key metrics such as gender distribution, ethnic diversity, hiring and promotion trends, and employee responses to inclusion-related surveys. It includes slicers and filters that allow users to explore data by department, role, and time period, making it easy to identify gaps or patterns that require attention.

The visuals are crafted to promote data-driven decision-making in HR and leadership teams, encouraging transparency and accountability in fostering an inclusive workplace. With a focus on clarity and usability, the report supports the development of policies aimed at improving equity and diversity.

This .pbix file contains all the data models, calculated measures, and visualizations necessary to explore diversity dynamics in any organizational setting. It can be adapted and extended with new datasets or customized KPIs based on the specific needs of your organization.
